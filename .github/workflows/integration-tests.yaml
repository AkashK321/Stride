#
# TRIGGERS:
#   1. Called by infrastructure-deploy (workflow_call):
#      - Automatically triggered after successful stack deployment
#      - Receives: api_endpoint, stack_name, branch_name
#   2. Manual trigger (workflow_dispatch):
#      - Can be run manually with required inputs:
#        * api_endpoint: API Gateway endpoint URL
#        * stack_name: CloudFormation stack name
#        * branch_name: Branch name for context
#   3. Pull request label (optional):
#      - Can be triggered by adding a label like "run-tests" to PR
